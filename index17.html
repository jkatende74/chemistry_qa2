Luminous flame is yellow, while non-luminous is blue. 3. Luminous is unsteady and large, while non-luminous is steady and short. 4.

The left side has 0 moles of gas (CaCO₃ is solid), while the right side has 1 mole of gas (CO₂). The shift to the left reduces the number of gas molecules, thus lowering the pressure."

            answer: "a) Increase in pressure: The equilibrium shifts to the right, increasing the yield of ammonia. The forward reaction produces fewer moles of gas (4 moles on left, 2 moles on right), so shifting right helps to reduce the pressure.<br>b) Decrease in temperature: The equilibrium shifts to the right, increasing the yield of ammonia.

            answer: "Increasing the pressure of reacting gases decreases the volume they occupy, bringing the gas particles closer together. This increases their concentration and the frequency of collisions, thus increasing the reaction rate. Solids and liquids are virtually incompressible, so changing pressure has a negligible effect on their concentration or the distance between particles, and thus minimal effect on the reaction rate."

            answer: "Catalyst: Vanadium(V) oxide (V₂O₅). Effect of pressure: Equilibrium shifts to the right, increasing the yield of SO₃. Forward reaction has fewer moles of gas (3 moles → 2 moles). Effect of temperature: Equilibrium shifts to the left, decreasing the yield of SO₃. Forward reaction is exothermic, so increasing temperature favours the endothermic reverse reaction."

            question: "What is overvoltage and how does it affect electrolysis?",
            answer: "Overvoltage is the extra voltage beyond the theoretical decomposition potential required to cause electrolysis. It occurs due to kinetic barriers at the electrodes. Overvoltage affects which ions are discharged when multiple ions are present and can make some reactions more difficult than predicted by standard electrode potentials."

            question: "Explain why the solubility of alkanols decreases as the hydrocarbon chain length increases.",
            answer: "Alkanols consist of a polar hydroxyl (-OH) group and a non-polar hydrocarbon chain. The -OH group can form hydrogen bonds with water, making short-chain alkanols soluble. As the hydrocarbon chain length increases, the non-polar part becomes dominant, making the molecule less polar overall and less able to interact effectively with polar water molecules, thus decreasing solubility."

        },
        {
            question: "Explain why solubility of alkanoic acids decreases with increasing RMM.",
            answer: "Alkanoic acids have a polar carboxyl (-COOH) group and a non-polar hydrocarbon chain. The -COOH group forms hydrogen bonds with water. As the non-polar hydrocarbon chain length (and RMM) increases, it disrupts hydrogen bonding with water more significantly, making the molecule less soluble."
        },
        {
            question: "Give two reasons why ethanol is used as a fuel.",
            answer: "1. It burns readily in air with a clean (non-sooty) flame. 2. It is highly exothermic (releases a large amount of heat energy upon combustion). 3. It can be produced renewably (e.g., from fermentation of biomass)."
