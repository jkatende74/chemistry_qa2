                        answer: "a) Splint F was in the cooler, inner part of the flame, which resulted in less burning, while splint G was in the hotter, upper/outer part of the flame, causing it to burn more.<br>b) Non-luminous flame."

                        answer: "a) The ion B⁺ has more occupied energy levels (3) than ion A⁺ (2). This means its outermost electrons are further from the nucleus, resulting in a larger ionic radius.<br>b) Both C²⁺ and A⁺ have the same number of electrons (10) and the same number of occupied energy levels (2). However, C²⁺ has a greater nuclear charge (12 protons) than A⁺ (11 protons). This stronger positive charge pulls the electron cloud in more tightly, resulting in a smaller ionic radius for C²⁺."

Luminous flame is yellow, while non-luminous is blue. 3. Luminous is unsteady and large, while non-luminous is steady and short. 4.

It separated the extract into the highest number of components (6 spots), indicating it is the best at resolving the mixture.<br>b) The ink in a ballpoint pen is itself a mixture of dyes and would be separated by the chromatography process, interfering with the results of the plant extract."

It burns in air to form sulphur dioxide (strongly acidic) and some sulphur trioxide.<br>b) The product was dissolved in water, and then blue and red litmus papers were dipped into the resulting solution. An acidic solution turns blue litmus paper red. A basic solution turns red litmus paper blue." },
